      <description>In this activity, I use the data from 2014 ACS 1-year estimates https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml.
The purpose is to use D3 to demonstrate the ability to build a personal customised interactive chart using D3 to visualise the relationship between health risks and social demography backgrounds.
Interactive chart using D3 We can see there are some correlation between Poverty and lack of healthcare, or correlation between obesity and household Income&amp;hellip;

      <description>Road traffic is the most common traffic in the world. We commute daily using cars, motorbikes, or buses &amp;hellip; How safe for us to go out of the house and enter road traffic? Does road traffic become safer in the last ten years? Which states have the most incidents? What are some of the high-risk factors involved in vehicle crashes? I used the dataset from https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI/ to get the crash data in the USA for the last ten years.</description>

      <description>My little Family I am a father of two lovely sons and a husband of a dedicated wife. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working in the supply chain field. Codding is my hobby and creating scripts to automate repeated jobs is my passion.
Before this, I worked in manufacturing and project management. I&amp;rsquo;m proficient in manufacturing and supply chain processes as well as ERP systems.
I had a degree in Electrical Engineering from Portland State University, USA , where I built a mesh network of 8 anemometers, collected wind data and sent it wirelessly through a Zigbee hub, stored the data on a server and displayed it on a website.</description>
