      <description>As a coffee lover, I am always keen to explore the data regarding coffee production, import/export and consumption worldwide.
In this project, I will visualise the above data on various charts, including choropleth, line chart and bar chart. The charts are interactive, and the user can choose multiple filters to display the desired data.
This is a completed standalone project in which the data was loaded to Postgres database and hosted online (Heroku).</description>

      <title>Interactive Map using Leaflet</title>

      <description>In this activity, I used the leaflet library to visualise the worldwide earthquakes in the last 7 days. The up-to-date data was pulled from United States Geological Survey, (USGS) through an API call. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.</description>

      <description>In this activity, I use the data from 2014 ACS 1-year estimates https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml.
The purpose is to use D3 to demonstrate the ability to build a personal customised interactive chart using D3 to visualise the relationship between health risks and social demography backgrounds.
Interactive chart using D3 We can see there are some correlation between Poverty and lack of healthcare, or correlation between obesity and household Income&amp;hellip;

      <description>Road traffic is the most common traffic in the world. We commute daily using cars, motorbikes, or buses &amp;hellip; How safe for us to go out of the house and enter road traffic? Does road traffic become safer in the last ten years? Which states have the most incidents? What are some of the high-risk factors involved in vehicle crashes? I used the dataset from https://crashviewer.nhtsa.dot.gov/CrashAPI/ to get the crash data in the USA for the last ten years.</description>

      <guid>https://datng87.github.io/post/activity-weather-visualisation/</guid>
      <description>In this activity, I&amp;rsquo;ll take the weather data of 500+ randomly selected cities around the world then analyse the data to see any relations between cities lat/lon and its weather.
Here is how I approached the problem:
Firstly, I generated 500+ random lat/lon data Used citipy to find the nearest city to those lat/lon Then, I connect to the weather API (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather) to take the weather data of those cities The last step is to use Pandas to prepare the data and visualise it Below are some findings:</description>

      <description>In this activity, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dashboard shows the background of each individual and what type of bacteria was found in that person&amp;rsquo;s belly.
Interactive dashboard Visit https://datng87.github.io/plotly-challenge/ for a live demo website. The code can be found at https://github.com/datng87/plotly-challenge.</description>
