      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm.

He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description>

In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>
